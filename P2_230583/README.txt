I added the following modifications and new functionalities to the game: 
- Visuals: a small heart model that flies up from any saved sheep. 

- Sound Effects: three sound efects. A sound for when the machine shoots a hay. A sound for when a sheep is saved (hit by a hay). A sound for when a sheep falls (dropped).

- Keeping Score: two counters to store the amount of sheep saved and dropped

- Manipulating User Interfaces: to view the scores in the UI.

- Title Screen Buttons: two clickable buttons (start and quit)

- Passing Data Between Scenes: I implemented the option to change the color of the hay machine in the game screen from the title screen.
